# Demoing Github API via GraphQL Ruby Gem

## What you'll need to run this graphql query

1. You'll need a [github access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and set it in the `['GITHUB_TOKEN']` environment variable to run this. 
2. `bundle install`
3. `GITHUB_TOKEN=ACCESS_TOKEN ruby initializer.rb`

I recommend reading [codeship tutorial](https://blog.codeship.com/an-introduction-to-graphql-via-the-github-api/) for an introduction to Graphql queries with the Gitub API
